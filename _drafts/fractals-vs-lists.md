As a software developer, have you ever faced such situation?
I bet you have.

You start to implement some feature in your project.
At the beginning, it looks very simple and innocent.
But as you get in, few obstacles appear.
You try to overcome them - and find new and new ones!
Suddently it appears that your simple task has grown in size for **multiple** times.

## Welcome to the _fractal trap_!

Let's explore an imaginary (but quite typical) situation.

Say we have a multi-step task.
We have discovered these steps beforehand and transformed into a simple straightforward-looking checklist.

And then we start to move through this list.

Few steps appear to be simple, but the others have suddently grown in size so they have become comparable to the parent!

There might be a _blocker_ or significant subtask for almost every simple step in your software project.

And finally, you've found that code needed to be changed is not covered with tests.
Much bad!

Of course, it's not a rant against refactoring or tests!
They are truly needed, especially in complex and aged codebases.
I rant against the way we've used to deal with tasks.

Fractal traps usually come from different sources: code coupling, leaky abstractions, and so on.
They are almost unavoidable.
I think it wouldn't be wrong to claim that the most of developers have to clash with them at least sometimes.
But how do we usually deal with such kind of problem?

## A classical approach üôà

The most naive approach to deal with this problem is a simple ignorance.
Each task is growing in size?
Ok, let's deal with it.
Just keep it going until the final goal is achieved.

Alas, by keeping all substeps in the same task we make them quite opaque.
_Something_ is happening in the task, and it will be finished _someday_.

Sometimes it's just fine...
But often it's not.

For example, let's imagine that your project have a strict delivering policy.
You cannot deliver your code until it's "done".
This means you have to roll all your changes altogether.
How long your feedback cycle will become?
How many code conflicts you'll have to resolve during the merge?

Also, you should mind the cognitive load.
The bigger is your task, the more nuances you have to keep in your head.
Actual consequences of your changes, potential consequences, potential compatibility breaks, questions you're unsure about, and so on.

Of course, this typical problem has very typical solution.
Let's proceed to it.

## The modern approach

**TODO**: work here

Extract big steps into separate tasks (lack of connectivity; more manual work)

![test](/images/fractals-vs-lists/5.png)

But there is a serious dilemma hidden in usual "linear" task manager.
In one hand, if you don't split tasks they become big and messy.
In other hand, when you split tasks it becomes too easy to lose _connections_ between tasks.
It becomes too hard to see the whole picture.
It becomes unclear when a single issue causes a bottleneck for several features.

**NB**: Trunk-based development

## Respect the structure

Because most tools are task-oriented, and relations between these tasks are second-class citizens.
How can you spot the fractal structure when the only thing you get is a big pile of tickets?

This article wouldn't appear without influence of following people:

1. [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron) in her ["Code is a coastline"](https://jessitron.com/2020/09/19/code-is-a-coastline/) have inspired me to write own thoughts about fractal nature of software tasks.
2. [Ola Ellnestam](https://twitter.com/ellnestam) and [Daniel Brolund](https://twitter.com/danielbrolund) with their ["The Mikado Method"](https://www.manning.com/books/the-mikado-method) book have changed my way of thinkning about tasks.
After several years of practicing I find it way more natural, easy and practical than the classical big-ticket-oriented approach.
3. [Sergey Tslovalnikov](https://twitter.com/SerCeMan), my Russian ex-coleague, gave me much ehough courage to write in English.

Once I've tried to use Disqus, but it was _a kind of mess_ that I don't want to be repeated.
