title: Now working at GridGain
---

About 2 month ago I've left Yandex for working at GridGain Rus.

Spending almost 2 years in Yandex was an interesting experience, but I cannot name it fruitful or delighting.
Somewhere in the middle of this journey I've fallen into a "big tech cultural trap" that was [perfectly preparated by Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/culture/).
Instead of fighting it or adapting myself, I've decided to leave.

Now, I'm a SDET at GridGain.
I feel the best opportunities to apply my skills, my knowledge, and my passion here.

Please stay tuned: this blog is not abandoned, and I plan to post more thoughts from time to time.

Peace to y'all!✌️
